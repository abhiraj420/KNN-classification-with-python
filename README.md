# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification - Animal Type Prediction
# Overview
This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classifying animal types based on a given dataset. The project follows a structured workflow, including data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The classifier's performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, and decision boundaries are visualized to understand the model's behavior.

# Dataset
The dataset contains features related to different animal types. The goal is to classify animals based on these attributes.

# Project Workflow
# Data Analysis & Visualization
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
* Use visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
# Data Preprocessing
* Handle missing values and outliers.
* Normalize or standardize features if required.
#Data Splitting
* Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
# KNN Model Implementation
* Train the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier using scikit-learn.
* Choose an optimal value for K and an appropriate distance metric.
# Model Evaluation
* Evaluate the classifier using metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Visualize the confusion matrix.

# Decision Boundary Visualization
Plot decision boundaries to understand how the classifier distinguishes between different animal types.
# Key Learnings
* Understanding the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
* Data analysis and preprocessing techniques.
* Importance of choosing the right K value and distance metric.
* Model evaluation using performance metrics.
* Decision boundary visualization in classification problems.
